My name is **Brian**. My passion is in **databases and storage systems**. 

From a **technical perspective**, I’m drawn to databases because it touches almost every field in computer science, from distributed systems to programming languages and from operating systems to networking. I love learning new things and I feel like there are layers and layers of mind-blowing knowledge waiting for me to peel through.

My **learning philosophy** is to learn things deeply. I’m a fan of John Carmack’s approach to learning, which is all about “knowledge in depth … about not just having this surface level understanding to... but to understand them through and through”. I think the best way to learn things is to build it from scratch. Like Richard Feynman once said, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. In my free time, I like to choose a project I’m curious about, learn how it works, and build a toy version of it from scratch. Many blogs I write about are about the toy projects I’ve built.

The **type of products I’m most excited about** is databases or systems that significantly reduce the complexity of a certain type of application. James Cowling, the creator of Convex, once said that “the infrastructure that exists on the market reflects the shape of the underlying technical solution, not the shape of the problems people face”. I believe that a lot of times the problem isn’t the technology or performance, but rather the wrong abstractions.

Apart from coding, I really enjoy **photography**. I enjoy chasing sunsets and sunrises. I also really enjoy playing and watching **basketball**. I am avid Stephen Curry fan and I would love to see him win his 5th ring.
