My name is **Brian**. My passion is in **databases**, **application frameworks**, and **programming languages**. 

I am interested in the intersection between databases and application frameworks. I believe that databases are more than just a means for storing data. The right database abstractions and application framework that match the shape of the problems programmers face can not only simplify the job of the programmer but also serve as a framework for the developer to think about the problem more intuitively.

I am quite new to the field of databases so my current goal is to learn as much as I can about the primitives and design choices behind different types of databases and systems. I think the best way to learn something new is to build prototypes. Like Richard Feynman once said, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. In my free time, I like to choose a topic I'm curious about, build a toy version of it, and write about it.

Apart from coding, I also enjoy photography and watching basketball. Check out my photography instagram account [here](https://www.instagram.com/brianshihphotography/)!
