My name is **Brian**. My passion is in **databases**, **application frameworks**, and **programming languages**. 

I believe that databases are more than just a means for storing data. Databases also serve as frameworks within which developers think about data and function. James Cowling, the creator of Convex, once said that “the infrastructure that exists on the market reflects the shape of the underlying technical solution, not the shape of the problems people face”. I am interested in studying how new database abstractions change the way programmers build applications.

My learning philosophy is to build prototypes. I think the best way to learn something new is to build it from scratch. Like Richard Feynman once said, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. In my free time, I like to choose something I'm curious about, build a toy version of it, and write about it.

Apart from coding, I enjoy photography and watching basketball.
