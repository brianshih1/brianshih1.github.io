My name is **Brian**. My passion is in **databases**, **serverless technologies**, **application frameworks**, and **programming languages**. 

I am interested in the intersection between databases and application frameworks. I believe that databases are more than just a means for storing data. The right database abstractions and application framework for a problem not only simplifies the work for the programmer, but also serve as a framework for the developer to think about the problem more intuitively.

I am quite new to systems programming so my current goal is to learn the primitives and design choices behind different types of storage and compute systems. I think the best way to learn something new is to build prototypes. Like Richard Feynman once said, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. In my free time, I like to choose a topic I'm curious about, build a toy version of it, and write about it.

Apart from coding, I also enjoy watching basketball and photography. Check out my photography Instagram account [here](https://www.instagram.com/brianshihphotography/)!
